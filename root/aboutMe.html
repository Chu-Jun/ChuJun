            <p>Greetings! I am an aspiring Computer Science enthusiast currently pursuing my undergraduate studies 
                in Bachelor of Computer Science at USM, Malaysia. Delving into the dynamic world of technology has been my passion. 
                <br><br>Since I was young, I've been fascinated by how computers shape our world. Now, as a student, 
                I'm diving into the heart of this dynamic field. My academic pursuits have not only solidified my 
                technical foundation but also honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. I have had the privilege 
                of studying a wide range of subjects, from data structures and algorithms to databases and artificial 
                intelligence. The hands-on projects I've undertaken have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to 
                real-world scenarios, fostering a deep understanding of how technology shapes our lives.
                <br><br>In the ever-evolving world of technology, I firmly believe that learning is a continuous process. 
                I am always on the lookout for the latest trends and advancements in Computer Science. 
                I'm excited to keep growing as a tech enthusiast. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to the dynamic field of 
                computer science, whether through innovative solutions or research endeavours, with the aim of making a meaningful impact.
                <br><br>Thanks for dropping by my site.
